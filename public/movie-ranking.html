<h1>The Best Movies According to Vicky</h1>

<h2>My Top 4 Movies of ALL-TIME!</h2>

<hr />

<h3>First Wives Club</h3>
<p>Story, comedic timing and the cast - I MEANNN talk about female empowerment.</p>

<h3>My Cousin Vinny</h3>
<p>They simply don't make movies like this anymore. The jokes still hit the same - from when I watched it the first time. </p>

<h3>Uncle Buck</h3>
<p>I usually watch this around the holidays. Again, another funny movie that wouldn't be the same if it was made today. </p>

<h3>Shrek</h3>
<p>Prime cleaning movie - the sound track and innuendos can't be compared.</p>
